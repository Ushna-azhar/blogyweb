# Next.js Tutorial

**Next.js** is a powerful React framework that enables developers to build highly optimized, full-stack web applications with ease. It's known for its **server-side rendering (SSR)**, **static site generation (SSG)**, and **API routes**, among other features.

## Key Features of Next.js

### 1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
Next.js provides the ability to render web pages on the server instead of the client. This improves SEO and performance, as search engines can easily crawl server-rendered pages. Pages are dynamically generated at the request time, ensuring up-to-date content.

### 2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**
With SSG, Next.js pre-renders pages at build time, which results in faster page loads. These pages are served as static files and can be cached, further enhancing performance. It's ideal for blogs, portfolios, and other content-heavy websites.

### 3. **API Routes**
Next.js allows you to create API endpoints inside the same project. This eliminates the need for a separate backend server. You can define RESTful APIs in the `pages/api` directory, making it easy to add server-side functionality to your React app.

### 4. **File-Based Routing**
Next.js uses a file-based routing system. The structure of your `pages` directory determines the routes of your application. This makes routing intuitive and easy to maintain, as you don’t have to worry about configuring route paths manually.

### 5. **Automatic Code Splitting**
Next.js automatically splits the JavaScript code, so only the required code for the current page is loaded. This reduces initial load time and improves performance. You don’t need to manually configure code splitting or lazy loading.

### 6. **Image Optimization**
Next.js provides built-in image optimization. Images are automatically served in the most efficient format and size depending on the user's device. It supports responsive images, lazy loading, and automatic resizing.

### 7. **Built-in CSS and Sass Support**
Next.js supports global styles, CSS modules, and Sass, making it easy to style your app. You can import CSS files directly in your components or pages. Additionally, Next.js supports **PostCSS**, which allows you to use modern CSS features and utilities like Tailwind CSS.

### 8. **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**
Next.js comes with built-in HMR, which enables faster development. Changes you make to your code are reflected instantly in the browser without needing a full reload.

### 9. **TypeScript Support**
Next.js has out-of-the-box support for TypeScript. Simply create a `tsconfig.json` file, and Next.js will automatically configure TypeScript for you. This makes it easier to catch errors early and ensures better maintainability for large projects.

## Getting Started with Next.js

### Step 1: Install Next.js

You can create a new Next.js project using `create-next-app`:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-next-app
